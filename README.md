# Add/Remove Class Based on Scroll When Element Reaches Top of Window

This is a simple JavaScript function that adds or removes a CSS class from an element based on the user's scrolling behavior. Specifically, it adds the class when the element reaches the top of the viewport, and removes it when it goes out of view.

To use this function on your website, follow these steps:

1. Include the JavaScript code in your HTML file, either by copying and pasting it directly or by linking to an external file:

```html
<script>
// Insert the JavaScript code here
</script>
